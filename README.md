Very broadly, my interests lie in the histories and intersections of information science, feminist tech (or cyber/technofeminism), design, and labour.  

## 🧑🏻‍💻 Work &amp; activities

Since mid-2022, I've been spending most (≥40 hours/week) of my time as **Tech Weaver (Tech Lead)** in 🌱 [numun](https://numun.fund), the first dedicated fund for feminist tech in, and for the Larger World.

Outside of numun, I’m actively involved in the following organisations/initiatives:
- 🛠️ [PERIN+1S](https://perintis.tech), focusing on education and development of collective information & technologies -- under which 📚[C2O](https://c2o-library.net), community library & co-working - making - hacking space, is housed.
- 🦾 [SINDIKASI workers’ union](https://sindikasi.org), particularly in the East Java chapter
- 🧙🏻‍♀️ [PurpleCode](https://instagram.com/purplecode_id), a collective working towards a feminist tech as the continuum of our on-ground intersectional struggles.

## 📝 Writings

These days I rarely write as much as I used to, since I interface more with terminal, codespaces, and PM tools 👻 than word editor. But every now and then I do write some articles, and you can find them indexed in [Google Scholar](https://scholar.google.com/citations?hl=en&user=ceEO7PsAAAAJ).
